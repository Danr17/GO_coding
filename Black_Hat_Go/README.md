# Black Hat Go

This repo is a companion to my reading of [Black Hat Go book](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/black-hat-go/9781098122645/)  
The examples from the book are published under MIT Licence [HERE](https://github.com/blackhat-go/bhg)  

This repository I'm using to test out some concepts.
